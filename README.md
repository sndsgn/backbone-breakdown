#Backbone.js Breakdown

##A satisfactory step by step guide to creating a Backbone.js app
####Based on the [HowsTheWeather App] (https://github.com/DannyDelott/HowsTheWeather) by [Danny Delott] (https://github.com/DannyDelott)
#####There are many ways to create an app with Backbone.js. This is one implementation.
* * *

### General patterns in this impelentation
  - Main App Model - pass the AppView an instantiated collection and assign this to a variable
  - Main App View 
    - Specify the `el` to which you will append sub views
    - Instantiate the sub views, assign them to properties on the AppView, pass the instantiation the collection bound to the AppView and then render the view with an invocation of `render` 
    - Define the `render` method in which you append all the views to the specified `el` and then return `this` which is the AppView with all of the appended elements
  - Controllers or View which receive input from the user
    - `el` - Specify the `el` to which you will append elements 
    - `template` - Specify a `template` to which you will populate with user input data if requested in the view 
    - `events` - Define `events` that the view should listen for and the methods that should be invoked
    - `initialize` - Define the `initialize` method which will specify which event it will listen to on the model and what it should do once those events occur. This almost always includes invoking render.
    - `render` - Define a `render` method which will populate the template with data and append the view with HTML
    - View event methods - define the methods that should be invokded on the model when the specified event occurs
  - Sub View to main App View
    - `el` - Specify the `el` to which you will append elements 
    - `initialize` - Define the `initialize` method which will specify which event it will listen to on the model and what it should do once those events occur. This almost always includes invoking render.
    - `render` - Define a `render` method which will populate the template with data and append the view with HTML
  - Model
    - `defaults` - define default values and instantiate those variables
    - `initialize` - initialize the model
    - Model methods - define methods that should be invoked on the model from associated views
  - Collection:
    - `model` - specify the model bound to the collection
    - Collection methods - define methods that act on the entire collection.
    - AJAX and APIS - if using API you can populate the models in the collection with the data pulled from the API and make your request with a collection method
    - If making a call to an API make sure to add `.bind(this)` to the end of the AJAX request


### Map out your architecture

1. Place your main app model and view at the top
2. Below on the left side place your collections and the models to which they are bound as sub elements
3. Below on the right side place your view and their subviews and controllers as sub elements
4. List your events and functions
5. Make lines between models and views indicating whether it is a binding, a function or an event to show relationships

### Common errors
1. Use commas not `;` semicolons within the object you are passing to the `extend` method
2. If you don't define your `el` it will default to a `div` element generated by Backbone
3. `get` and `set` methods are for models

### Files to Create 

#### Typical approaches to folder structure are by Backbone object type such as models, collections and view or by feature type such as ToDoList, Calendar, and TimeTracker

1. Index.html 

   - Reference all Backbone files you will use in `<script src='FILEorURL_PATH_HERE'></script>` tags (in this order):
      - Libraries referencing the proper file path (in this order): `backbone-min.js`, `underscore-min.js`, and `jQuery-min.js`
      - Models, Collections, and Views
      - The main app file which instantiates the AppView and binds it to the main app collection

2. App.js 
  
   - Instantiate the AppView and initialize and instantiate its collection 
   ```
       var App = new AppView({ 
         collection: new Weather() 
       }); 
   ```

3. AppView.js
   - Initialize and extend Backbone View object
   `var AppView = Backbone.View.extend({`  
   - Specify the element to which you want to append the view
   `el: '#app',`
   - Within an `initialize` method definition and assignment, instantiate child views, assign them as properties to the AppView object and pass in their collection to which they will be bound. At the end invoke the `render` method.

   ```
       initialize: function() {

         this.title = new TitleView();

         this.input = new InputView({ 
           collection: this.collection
         });

         this.list = new ListView({
           collection: this.collection
         });

         this.render();
       }),
   ```
   - Initialize the AppView `render` method, append the `el` defined earlier with each subview and return `this` which will be bound to the HTML elements representing this view that you will add to the DOM
   ```
       render: function() {

         this.$el.append([
           this.title.$el,
           this.input.$el,
           this.list.$el
         ]);

         return this;
       }
   ```
   - Close your view initialization and `extend` method invocation
   ```
      });
   ```
        
4. WeatherEntry.js (the model - name the file whatever corresponds to your model) 
   - Instantiate your model and extend the App's Backbone Model object with this object 
    ```
       var WeatherEntry = Backbone.Model.extend({
    ```
   - Define your `defaults`
   ```
       defaults: {
         zipcode: '',
         city: '',
         weather: '',
         unit: '째F'
       },
   ```
   - Define your `initiatlize` function
   ```
       initialize: function() {},
   ```
   - Define any model methods that will be invoked from some action by the user in the model's view or another view
   ```
       toggleUnit : function() {
         var isImperial = this.get('unit') === '째F';
         if(isImperial) {
           var celcius = (this.get('weather') - 32) * (5/9);
           this.set({
             'unit': '째C',
             'weather' : celcius.toFixed(2)
           });
         } else {
           var fahrenheit = (this.get('weather') / (5 / 9)) + 32;
           this.set({
             'unit': '째F',
             'weather': fahrenheit.toFixed(2)
           });
         }
       }
   ```
   - Close your model initialization and `extend` method invocation
   ```
      });
   ```
      
5. EntryView.js (the model view - name the file to correspond to your model) 
   - Instantiate your model's view and extend the App's Backbone View object with this object 
    ```
        var EntryView = Backbone.View.extend({
    ```
   - Define the DOM element that you will bind to `el` and to which you will append HTML elements or content
   ```
       className: 'entry',
   ```
   - Initialize template HTML that you will populate with data for each model view 
   ```
      template: _.template('<p>It is currently <%= weather %><%= unit %> in <%= city %>.</p>'),
   ```
   - Specify which `events` the view should listen to that happen in its view and the name of the functions that should be invoked on the model as a result
   ```
      events: {
         'click' : 'clickAction'
      },
   ```
   - Define your `initiatlize` function and specify which events the view should listen for on the model and render the view once those events have occurred. Also render the view on instantiation. 
   ```
       initialize: function() {
         this.listenTo(this.model, 'change', this.render);
         this.render();
       },
   ```
   - Define your `render` method, the HTML it should append to the `el` using the `template` created earlier populating the variables `<%=VARIABLE%>` with data and invoke the `html` method on `el` with the HTML template you created
   ```
       render: function() {
         var entry = this.template({
           weather: this.model.get('weather'),
           unit: this.model.get('unit'),
           city: this.model.get('city')
         });
         this.$el.html(entry);
       },
   ```
   - Define the function that should be invoked when the defined view event occurs
   ```
      clickAction: function() {
        this.model.toggleUnit();
      }
   ```
   - Close your view initialization and `extend` method invocation
   ```
      });
   ```
 
6. InputView.js (the view associated with the input not tied to a model) 
   - Instantiate your model's view and extend the App's Backbone View object with this object 
    ```
        var InputView = Backbone.View.extend({
    ```
   - Define the DOM element that you will bind to `el` and to which you will append HTML elements or content
   ```
       tagName: 'input',
        // Same as el: '<input>',
   ```
   - Specify which `events` the view should listen to that happen in its view and the name of the functions that should be invoked on the model as a result
   ```
        events: {
          'keydown': 'keyAction',
        },
   ```
   - Define your `initiatlize` function and invoke the render method to render the view
   ```
        initialize: function() {
          this.render();
        },
   ```
   - Initialize the `render` method and invoke other functions required during re-rendering of the view 
   ```
        render: function() {
          this.resetInput();
          return this;
        },
   ```
   - Define the functions that should be invoked when the defined view event occurs
   ```
        keyAction: function(e) {

          var isEnterKey = (e.which === 13);

          if(isEnterKey && !this.$el.val().trim().match(/^(?=.*[0-9].*)[0-9]{5}$/)) {

            this.$el.attr({
              placeholder: 'Sorry, zip code invalid.'
            });
            this.clearInput();

          } else if(isEnterKey) {

            this.collection.addWeatherEntry(this.$el.val());
            this.resetInput();

          }

        },

        resetInput: function() {
          this.$el.attr({
            placeholder: 'Enter a zip code'
          });
          this.clearInput();
        },

        clearInput: function() {
          this.$el.val('');
        }

   ```
   - Close your view initialization and `extend` method invocation
   ```
      });
   ```
7. ListView.js (the view associated with the WeatherEntry model) 
   - Instantiate your model's view and extend the App's Backbone View object with this object 
    ```
        var ListView = Backbone.View.extend({
    ```
   - Define the DOM element that you will bind to `el` and to which you will append HTML elements or content
   ```
       id: 'list',
   ```
   - Define your `initiatlize` function and specify which events the view should listen for on the model and render the view once those events have occurred.
   ```
       initialize: function() {
         this.listenTo(this.model, 'add', this.render);
         //Same as this.collection.on('add', this.render, this);
       },
   ```
   - Initialize your `render` method, run the `empty` method on the `el` element to clear it of child elements previously appended, create a property that instantiates an entry view for each model object in the collection, for each entry view created for each model create a jQuery `$els` that is an array that contains and initializes a jQuery element `$el` for each EntryView, then then append each of those jQuery DOM element to the DOM element defined as `$el`, and then adds those elements to the DOM
   ```
       render: function() {

        this.$el.empty();

        this.entries = this.collection.models.map(function(model) {
          return new EntryView({
            model: model
          });
        });

        var $els = this.entries.map(function(entry) {
          return entry.$el;
        });

        this.$el.append($els);

        return this;
      }
  ```
   - Close your view initialization and `extend` method invocation
   ```
      });
   ```
8. TitleView.js (a view not associated with any model which creates the page title)
   - Instantiate your model's view and extend the App's Backbone View object with this object 
    ```
        var TitleView = Backbone.View.extend({
    ```
   - Define the DOM element that you will bind to `el` and to which you will append HTML elements or content
   ```
       tagName: 'input',
        // Same as el: '<input>',
   ```
   - Specify which `events` the view should listen to that happen in its view and the name of the functions that should be invoked on the model as a result
   ```
        events: {
          'keydown': 'keyAction',
        },
   ```
   - Define your `initiatlize` function and invoke the render method to render the view
   ```
        initialize: function() {
          this.render();
        },
   ```
   - Initialize the `render` method and invoke other functions required during re-rendering of the view 
   ```
        render: function() {
          this.$el.text('How\'s the weather?');
          return this;
        }
   ```
   - Close your view initialization and `extend` method invocation
   ```
      });
   ```
9. Weather.js (the collection which is passed the input value from the user which is added to the API call)
   - Specify the model to which the collection should be bound
   ```
     model: WeatherEntry,
   ```
   - Initialize a method which takes the user defined input from the input view and passes it as a variable to the API URL. Add the values returned by the API call to the `zipcode`, `city`, and `weather` properties accessing the response via the `data` paraemeter passed to the callback function in the AJAX request. Ensure you bind `this` in the API retrieval method to the model object and not the global object which in this case would be the window.
   ```
        addWeatherEntry: function(zipcode) {

          $.get(
              'http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?zip=' + zipcode + ',us&units=imperial',

              function(data) {

                this.add({
                  zipcode: zipcode,
                  city: data.name,
                  weather: data.main.temp.toFixed(2)
                });

              }.bind(this)
              );

        }
   ```
   - Close your view initialization and `extend` method invocation
   ```
      });
   ```
